## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- [Tailwind](https://tailwindcss.com/) - utility-first CSS framework
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - build tool

### Development notes

This is my first attempt at using Tailwind for building UI.

The main difficulty I experienced was installing and configuring Tailwind. Thankfully, the official docs have a detailed guide, I just didn’t know what I needed to look for.

Using the framework itself turned out to be quite easy. I can see now why so many developers like it.

I still haven’t figured out how to configure my code editor for Tailwind. I tried to install the plugin for sorting class names in the recommended order, but it did not work with the Prettier extension for VSCode. Please let me know if I was supposed to install Prettier as a package.

### Continued development

I quite liked Tailwind and the utility-based approach, and I will continue using it in future projects.
